# Manager / Worker Example

This directory contains an example of the Manager / Worker pattern.  It consists of the [Manager](./Manager/docs/sdd.md) component, [Worker](./Worker/docs/sdd.md) component, and [Subtopology](./Subtopology/docs/sdd.md) showing how to hook these components up.

This orchestration of components is instantiated in the [ExamplesDeployment](../ExamplesDeployment).
